![Build status](https://travis-ci.com/JoachimMakowski/BootstrapBuilder.svg?branch=main)

An application for web programmers who want to quickly create an application skeleton using the Bootstrap 4 framework. The program allows you to return the page code with a header, footer, as well as appropriate META tags in the context of plain SEO, Open Graph and Twitter. The application will be available via GUI, as well as as a remote API, so it can be integrated with existing tools.
